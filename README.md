# FormalModeling_MiniProjet

__M2 Formal Modeling project by Remy CHERKHAOUI, Quentin FELTEN and Daniil ROSSO,
students at Efrei Paris__

In this project, we designed an application running a Computation Tree Logic (or CTL for short) algorithm to check if a given Kripke structure satisfies a given CTL formula. 

## Running the application

Go to the project's directory:
```bash
cd FormalModeling_MiniProjet
```

Install all the necessary dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```

Start the application (default location is localhost:8080)
```bash
npm start
```
* Due to an unexplored bug, only the present files can be used by the program. (See _parser.js l.10_ or the corresponding part of the report for more information).

You can add your own Kripke structures and CTL formulae by **replacing file1.txt and file2.txt** in **\documents\test_files\\** and following the specified structure.

See the example at the end of the README for the correct structure.

Alternatively, you can try out your own CTLs directly in the application in the *custom-ctl* field.

## Logical Symbol interpretation for the input file

- NOT      → !(x)
- x AND y  → &(x,y)
- x OR y   → |(x,y)
- x THEN y → T(x,y)

## Glossary

- For All    → A
- Exists     → E
- Next x     → E(X(x)) or A(X(x))
- Globally x → E(G(x)) or A(G(x))
- Finally x  → E(F(x)) or A(F(x))
- x Until y  → E(U(x,y)) or A(U(x,y))

## Input format

- Let AP be a finite set of atomic propositions. A Kripke structure (KS for short) over AP is a 4-tuple (S, L, T, I) where :

  * **'S'** is a finite set of states ;
  * **'L'** is a labeling (or interpretation) function ;
  * **'T'** is a transition relation ;
  * **'I'** is the initial state ;

- CTL proposition in one line

### Example

This example is illustrated by the image _'file1.png'_.
This file can be found in the **\documents\test_files\\** folder.

List of states **S**:

`{S1, S2, S3}`

Label of each state **L**:

`{(S1, {p, q}), (S2, {q}), (S3, {p})}`

List of transitions **T**:

`{(S1, s2), (S2, S1), (S2, S3), (S3, S3)}`

Initial state **I**:

`{S1}`

CTL:

`!(&(p,q))`
